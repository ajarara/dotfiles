! I'm testing out keeping control control
! what I want to do is keep usage of my left pinky to a minimum
! and one way to do that is to stop chording with it.
! it will be missed but at the same time I can't keep using it
! as I'm starting to feel a dull pain in my left pinky
! :(
! instead I use the palm of my pinky to press down on control
! this is just a slight movement of the wrist.


! swap caps to control
! remove modifiers from the relevant keys
remove Lock = Caps_Lock
remove Control = Control_L
! remap the key labelled Ctrl to send Caps_Lock
keycode 37 = Caps_Lock

! remap the key labelled Caps_Lock to Ctrl
keycode 66 = Control_L

! readd their modifiers
add Lock = Caps_Lock
add Control = Control_L

! here is where the reasonable config stops

! make super Alt Gr
! 133 multi_key
remove mod4 = Super_L
keycode 133 = Multi_key Multi_key Multi_key

! make right control super
remove Control = Control_R
keycode 105 = Super_L Super_L
add mod4 = Super_L

! make right alt control
remove mod1 = Alt_R
keycode 108 = Control_R Control_R
add Control = Control_R

! make right button alt-y
! make pipe key our new alt. We need a key that exists.
keycode 51 = Alt_R
add mod1 = Alt_R

! we need this here so xcape can send it
keycode 255 = backslash bar
