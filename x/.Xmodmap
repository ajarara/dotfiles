! I'm testing out keeping control control
! what I want to do is keep usage of my left pinky to a minimum
! and one way to do that is to stop chording with it.
! it will be missed but at the same time I can't keep using it
! as I'm starting to feel a dull pain in my left pinky
! :(
! instead I use the palm of my pinky to press down on control
! this is just a slight movement of the wrist.


! swap caps to control
! remove modifiers from the relevant keys
remove Lock = Caps_Lock
remove Control = Control_L

! remap the key labelled Ctrl to send Caps_Lock
keycode 37 = Caps_Lock

! remap the key labelled Caps_Lock to Ctrl
keycode 66 = Control_L

! readd their modifiers
add Lock = Caps_Lock
add Control = Control_L

! remove modifer from right control
remove Control = Control_R

! send Control_R on PrtSc
keycode 107 = Control_R
add Control = Control_R

keycode 105 = Print
