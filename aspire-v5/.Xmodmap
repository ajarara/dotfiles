! this config does NOT use keysyms. That way it is completely idempotent.
! I really should move this to an org file someday

!swapping caps to control
!remove modifiers from the relevant keys
remove Lock = Caps_Lock
remove Control = Control_L
!remap the key labelled Ctrl to send Caps_Lock
keycode 37 = Caps_Lock
!remap the key labelled Caps_Lock to Ctrl
keycode 66 = Control_L
!readd their modifiers
add Lock = Caps_Lock
add Control = Control_L


!swapping multi_key for right control

!first remove the control modifier from right control
remove Control = Control_R

! the right control key is mapped to keycode 105 on my american w/ international keys keyboard, to find out what your mappings are run xev, hit the key, and look where it says keycode
! changed: now right ctrl is actually super. super is now multi-key.
keycode 105 = Super_R
add mod4 = Super_R

! remove super from Super_L
remove mod4 = Super_L
! make Super_L now send Multi_key. this isn't a modifier, but it sorta acts like one.
keycode 133 = Multi_key Multi_key

! now we map our Alt_Gr key to anything we want. On fedora, using a 105 key european layout (the euro sign on the 5 key), Alt_Gr is not added to the mod5 listing (AKA mode switch or ISO_Level3_Shift), you can confirm this for yourself by invoking xmodmap with no arguments. the numbers in parens are the keycodes in base 16 (this is NOT the same as keysym)


! further, the below does NOT add any functionality, we still must add the modifier
keycode 108 = Control_R Control_R


! add the control modifier to our now rebounded key
add Control = Control_R

! tried moving Return to alt. While it worked:
! 1) if it broke (and my xcape config has broken before) it would be infuriating.
! 2) when using vim (for the rare instances I have to edit system files and don't want to use tramp) vim behaved REALLY weirdly about it. (it would insert a capital M and ignore the enter signal).
! 3) Backslash is juuuust above it. Let's try that instead.
keycode 51 = Alt_R Alt_R

! now add the alt signal to it.
add mod1 = Alt_R

! now begins abo-abo's experiment: we play around with mode_switch!
! replace semicolon with mode_switch
! starting to like the fact that I can access a lot of symbols very quickly.
! not liking the fact that I have all these garbage characters. Instead I will stick with apostrophe as a modifier, and mode switch as a convenient way to enter several other characters.
keycode 47 = Mode_switch Mode_switch Mode_switch
