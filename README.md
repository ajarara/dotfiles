# Dotfiles
Personal config files that I wish to share across platforms. I use Guix and MacOS, today.

I use Guix to manage binaries between machines. A good next step might be to embed the config in the binary, but this has worked so far and I'd like to do other things.

## Installation
`./bootstrap.sh`: designed to fail fast and be idempotent, run this at any time.
