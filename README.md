# Dotfiles
A previous iteration of this had to deal with multiple machines living in one repo and had a pretty inconvenient symlink system. Instead I'm going to stick with real text files for configuration.

For now, Make'll just copy things into the underyling directory, assuming ./dotfiles doesn't exist so we don't encourage any recursion.
